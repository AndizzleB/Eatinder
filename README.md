## Installation

Based on [flask-vuejs-template](https://github.com/gtalarico/flask-vuejs-template). See the upstream project for updates and further details.

##### Before you start

Before getting started, you should have the following installed and running:

- [X] Yarn - [instructions](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable)
- [X] Vue Cli 3 - [instructions](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html)
- [X] Python 3
- [X] Pipenv (optional)
- [X] Heroku Cli (if deploying to Heroku)

##### Template and Dependencies

* Clone this repository:

	```
	$ git clone https://github.com/AndizzleB/Eatinder.git
	```

* Setup virtual environment, install dependencies, and activate it:

	```
	$ pipenv install --dev
	$ pipenv shell
	```

* Install JS dependencies

	```
	$ yarn install
	```


## Development Server

Run Flask Api development server:

```
$ python run.py
```

From another tab in the same directory, start the webpack dev server:

```
$ yarn serve
```

The Vuejs application will be served from `localhost:8080` and the Flask Api
and static files will be served from `localhost:5000`.

The dual dev-server setup allows you to take advantage of
webpack's development server with hot module replacement.

Proxy config in `vue.config.js` is used to route the requests
back to Flask's Api on port 5000.

If you would rather run a single dev server, you can run Flask's
development server only on `:5000`, but you have to build build the Vue app first
and the page will not reload on changes.

```
$ yarn build
$ python run.py
```


## Production Server

This template is configured to work with Heroku + Gunicorn and it's pre-configured
to have Heroku build the application before releasing it.

#### JS Build Process

Heroku's nodejs buidlpack will handle install for all the dependencies from the `packages.json` file.
It will then trigger the `postinstall` command which calls `yarn build`.
This will create the bundled `dist` folder which will be served by whitenoise.

#### Python Build Process

The python buildpack will detect the `Pipfile` and install all the python dependencies.

#### Release

The `Procfile` will run Django migrations and then launch Django's app using gunicorn, as recommended by heroku.
